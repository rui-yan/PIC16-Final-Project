(YouTube demo: https://youtu.be/li-Hd-VYLqc)

Game background:
The Powell Cat has been a staple to all students that have frequented by the Powell Library at UCLA over the past years, quickly becoming a student favorite. It was adopted by a Powell Librarian and considered as a UCLA mascot, like Bruin Bear.

Game rules:
- Along the road, the cat can collect books to get points. The more books collect, the higher the points. But the bombs are randomly moving, and collision needs to be avoided.
- The cat has three parts: head, body, and tail. After collecting a book, the length of the cat’s body will increase by one, i.e. the score will increase by one.
- In each difficulty level, the speeds of both the cat and the bomb will change. The speed is low in easy mode, mediate in median mode and high in hard mode.
- The player can control the “Cat” to move in four different directions: up, down, left, right. (Note that if the cat goes into the opposite direction of its movement, it will collide this its own body and die.)
- The game will end in the following circumstances: (1) the cat hits an edge; (2) the cat hits his own body; (3) that cat hits a bomb; (4) game player manually quits the game; (5) the cat collects as many books as possible and wins the game.
